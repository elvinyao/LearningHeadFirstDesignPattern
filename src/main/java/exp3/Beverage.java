/**
 * Design Principle: Classes should be open for extension,but closed for modification.
 * <p>
 * “The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to
 * subclassing for extending functionality.”
 *
 * “Inheritance is one form of extension, but not necessarily the best way to achieve flexibility in our designs.
 * In our designs we should allow behavior to be extended without the need to modify existing code.
 * Composition and delegation can often be used to add new behaviors at runtime.
 * The Decorator Pattern provides an alternative to subclassing for extending behavior.
 * The Decorator Pattern involves a set of decorator classes that are used to wrap concrete components.
 * Decorator classes mirror the type of the components they decorate. (In fact, they are the same type as the components they decorate, either through inheritance or interface implementation.)
 * Decorators change the behavior of their components by adding new functionality before and/or after (or even in place of) method calls to the component.
 * You can wrap a component with any number of decorators.
 * Decorators are typically transparent to the client of the component—that is, unless the client is relying on the component’s concrete type.
 * Decorators can result in many small objects in our design, and overuse can be complex.”
